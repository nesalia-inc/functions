# Understanding Monads

Monads are a design pattern from functional programming that helps manage side effects, errors, and optional values in a type-safe way.

## What is a Monad?

A monad is a design pattern that wraps a value and provides two operations:

1. Return or Unit: Wrap a value in the monad
2. Bind or FlatMap: Transform the wrapped value

## Why Monads Matter

Monads allow you to:
- Handle errors explicitly
- Chain operations safely
- Manage side effects
- Maintain type safety

## Result Type

The Result type represents operations that can succeed or fail.

## Async Result

AsyncResult is Promise of Result.

## Maybe Type

The Maybe type represents optional values.

## Unit Type

The Unit type represents functions with no meaningful return value.

## Creating Values

```ts
import { success } from "@deessejs/functions";

const result = success({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });
```

## Utility Functions

### map

Transform the value.

### chain

Chain operations that return Results.

### unwrapOr

Get the value or a default.
